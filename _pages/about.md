I am Florian Dorner, a doctoral fellow with the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems advised by Moritz Hardt and Fanny Yang. I hold an MSc. in Mathematics from FU Berlin and an MSc. in Science, Technology and Policy from ETH Zurich.

I am interested in understanding the societal impacts of Artificial Intelligence and how policy and technical research can interface to shape these impacts. 

These days, most of my work focuses on the role of data in evaluating various aspects of Machine Learning pipelines. Recent strains of work include <a href="/Publication/llmjudge">theoretical limitations to using LLMs for evaluating other models</a>, the <a href="/Publication/labelnoise">efficient use of human feedback for model evaluation</a>, the <a href="/Publication/personality"> (lack of) validity of applying tests designed for humans to LLMs</a>, and <a href="/Publication/federated">ways to identify and disincentivize data manipulation in federated learning</a>.
